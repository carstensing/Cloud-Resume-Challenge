# Cloud Resume Challenge <!-- omit from toc -->

It has been two and a half years since I graduated with a BS in Computer
Science and I've yet to land a job in the field. With an ordinary resume and no
coding job experience, I've decided to take on Forrest Brazeal's [Cloud Resume
Challenge][CRC] and start a career in cloud.

## AWS Certification

With basically zero cloud experience starting out, studying for the AWS
Certified Cloud Practitioner exam gave me the foundation I needed for the CRC.
I easily spent over 60 hours studying, which includes doing over 1900 practice
problems. Here is a list of free resources that I used to pass the exam (Oct
2024):

- [Andrew Brown's lecture videos][lecture]
- [Sthithapragna's practice questions][questions]

**Note:**

Make sure the resources that you study are up to date with the current version
of the exam and exam outline. I studied old material without realizing and this
set me back some time.
