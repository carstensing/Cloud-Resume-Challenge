# Cloud Resume Challenge <!-- omit from toc -->

It has been two and a half years since I graduated with a BS in Computer
Science and I've yet to land a job in the field. With an ordinary resume and no
coding job experience, I've decided to take on Forrest Brazeal's [Cloud Resume
Challenge][CRC] and start a career in cloud.

## AWS Certification

With basically zero cloud experience starting out, studying for the AWS
Certified Cloud Practitioner exam gave me the foundation I needed for the Cloud
Resume Challenge. I easily spent over 60 hours studying, which includes doing
over 1900 practice problems. Here is a list of free resources that I used to
pass the exam (Oct 2024):

- [Andrew Brown's lecture videos][lecture]
- [Sthithapragna's practice questions][questions]

Make sure you study material is up to date with the current version of the exam
and exam outline. I studied old material without realizing and this set me back
some time.

## Hugo Static Site

I wanted to create a website that I could use for more than my resume.
Something simple that worked with Markdown so I could reuse my repository
READMEs. My search lead me to a static website framework called Hugo. Hugo
builds and serves the site to a localhost, providing a real-time preview of the
site. This is super handy for developing locally before moving onto hosting
with AWS. Overall, I'm happy that I chose to use Hugo over building a basic
HTML and CSS static site that I would dread updating.

## AWS Organization

AWS Organizations is a centralized account management service that helps
businesses manage multiple AWS accounts efficiently. It provides security,
governance, cost optimization, and automation at scale.

Okay great, but why did I use it for a single-person project? Besides to get
some hands-on experience, here is what I found:

### Account Protection

Using the AWS root account for development is a bad practice due to its
unlimited privileges, making it prone to accidental misconfigurations or
deletions that cannot be restricted by IAM policies. It also poses a
significant security risk since a compromised root account grants full control
over all AWS resources. This can cost **thousands** of dollars! So to protect
yourself from yourself and attackers, develop in a member account, not root.

### IAM Roles and Policies

Member accounts have their permissions set by root. I gave my dev account
PowerUserAccess, which grants full access to AWS services and resources, but
does not allow management of Users and groups. Sounds like that should be all I
need to code some stuff right? Nope! Thanks to IAM roles and policies.

**Roles** are like **logos** that are assigned to users, groups, or services,
representing their identity and the level of access they have. **Policies** are the
specific **permissions** that are attached to a role (or directly to a user or
group), defining what actions they can perform.

Imagine a facility with different levels of security. They hire a cleaning
company, and anyone with the company logo (role) on their uniform or vehicle is
allowed on-site. However, the cleaning crew doesn't have access to the fourth
floor of the building. The role is the cleaning company's logo, and the policy
is the restriction that they cannot go to the fourth floor.

The companyâ€™s vehicle (which could be used for drop-offs) also has the logo and
can enter the premises. However, not just anyone can drive the vehicle; only
authorized drivers (users with the correct role) can use it. The driver assumes
the role associated with the vehicle and is granted access based on the
permissions attached to that role. This is an example of a service role that
can be assumed by users to gain temporary access to resources they otherwise
wouldn't have.

As I moved from one service to another, I found what permissions I was lacking.
Following the principle of least privilege, I added only the permissions
required for each specific task. This incremental approach helped me learn how
services use IAM roles and policies, and how they impact development on AWS.

### Free Tier

The hack to creating member accounts is to use email sub-addressing instead of
creating a new email. For example, if the root email is myemail@mail.com, the
dev account can be created with myemail+dev@mail.com. Even if the root account
is no longer eligible for the Free Tier, the member accounts are eligible
because they are newly created. After a year, when the dev account loses Free
Tier eligibility, simply create another dev account with a different
sub-address. Infinite Free Tier!

Be aware that even with multiple Free Tier accounts within an organization, the
benefits don't stack. If one or more accounts are Free Tier eligible, the
entire organization shares the Free Tier benefits.

### SSO Login

With an organization, SSO allows users to never need long lived credentials.
Logging in this way is really easy and helps prevent accidental leaks
of AWS credentials on GitHub. Again, AWS can cost a lot of money _really fast_
and this is one of the most likely ways an account can be compromised. Just
make sure to set the session time to more than an hour because logging in eight
times a day is a headache.

## S3, HTTPS and DNS

I purchased a domain name through Route 53 and created an S3 bucket to store my
website files built by Hugo. Make sure the hosted zone's name servers match
where traffic is being routed. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out why
DNS wasn't working because of this. After that, I used CloudFront to enable
HTTPS. AWS has tutorials on how to do all of this, which made it very easy.

## DynamoDB, Lambda, API Gateway and JavaScript

I learned a **ton** on this chuck of the project. I understood the concept of
how a website, a database and an API interacted, but actually building it all
really challenged me.
